I went to the [SVP annual meetings](http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Home.aspx) last week to do a talk and a [workshop](http://phylo.wikidot.com/beastmaster#toc0). Here are some things that I learned about conferencing internationally while pregnant.

+ I kind of wish I had bought the compression socks for the long flight. But I got up and stretched often and kept hydrated and recovered quickly on the ground. 
+ Drinking fountains are not as common in non-US countries, so check ahead if the tapwater is good.
+ Pack some saltines. Even though I didn't have morning sickness before leaving, the upset of travel left me a little ill. Wish I had done this.
+ Room snacks. This is what kept me from becoming a monster. I packed nuts, dried fruit and pretzels. Bought plums and yogurt in Berlin. For contrast, hotel breakfast was like 20 bucks.
+ The caffeine limitation is just bad news. Sorry, lady.
+ Schedule important meetings early in the week. If you're ill and can't make it, you still have time to reschedule.
+ Be proactive about things to which you would like to go versus things to which you *must* go. I needed mid-day rest, and found it hard to go to talks immediately after lunch. Everybody's different, and your body is pretty good about telling you what it needs.
+ Networking is harder. I was too tired to be out super late. If you saw a talk, and you liked it, and you know that you'll be immobile by 10 pm, be forward about trying to get together with that person.
+ Be focused. When people find out you're pregnant, they might want to talk about their experiences having a kids and ask you questions about the baby. They're happy for you! But if there's something you *need* out of that interaction, practice good steering and keep the conversation on track.
    + Relatedly: I'm an open book; I realize not everyone is. Decide what your boundaries are for discussion in a professional setting, and politely defend them.
 
I got a lot out of this meeting, without feeling like I was stretching myself too thin. Add your own helpful conference stuff in the comments.
