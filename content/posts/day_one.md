Title: CCBB Day One
Date: 2014-05-19 11:15
Category: Python, Education
Slug: day-one
Authors: April Wright 

## What worked

*   Base Python: People generally found Python intuitive*   Hands-On: We did a lot of hands-on (about 25 minute per hour, plus a break every hour and a half)
*   Minute papers: We  got a lot of good feedback from these

## What didn't

*   Installs: A few people hadn't installed things
*   Git: I think this was a little much for first thing for total novices, but we mostly got this working
*   I got turned around and a bit flustered with helping people in the start, getting everyone used to the course website + etherpad. I still get flustered.

## What's up tomorrow:

*   Syncing course repos with personal, and pushing a first bit of text
*   Reviewing exercises from yesterday
*   File I/O
