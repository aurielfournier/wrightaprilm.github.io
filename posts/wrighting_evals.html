    <h2>Writing a good evaluation is hard.</h2>
<p>People often tell me to pick a couple things I want students in a course to have known and ask if they learned them. I think practically this is useful, but doesn't get at the full picture. There are lots of reasons a student might not learn something in a semester-long course. For instance, a few students have communicated to me that their PIs don't think it's worth it to take a course on computing, and won't give them an hour and a half in the afternoon to come to class, resulting in doing  a lot of learning on their own. Some people like Facebook more than doing programming exercises.</p>
<p>What evaluation should really get at is what the instructors and other course facilitators could do to support learners. Which of our materials are students using? Which are they not? Are there some lectures that don't go well? How is our balance of exercise to talk time? What practical things could we do to improve the course?</p>
<p>Our round of evaluations following the first offering of the course went pretty well. People over all liked the course. They liked cheatsheets of core programming concepts from each lecture. They wanted homework to be assigned. They wanted more in-class exercises.</p>
<p>So this time around, we offered more in-class exercises. We assigned homework. We made cheatsheets for lectures that didn't previously have them (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_5/pandas_dtypes.md">Pandas types</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_5/pandas_slicing.svg">visual cheatsheet</a> to slicing/indexing. In short, this was a better course for long-term learning.</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>I picked a few main things that I wanted to know from students:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What was the level of effort they put into the course?
    +Was there anything we could do to get them to increase that level of effort?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did the students feel during class (lost, bored, etc)?</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we do to improve their experience?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can they do some basic Python tasks?</p>
<ul>
<li>If not, what could we do help them pick up concepts?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did they <em>like</em> programming?</p>
<ul>
<li>If not, then we don't like you and you can't come to my birthday party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Getting at what learners learned is hard. We've gotten some feedback in the form of homeworks. Turned in homeworks were consistently great, but most students didn't actually turn in homework weekly. More on this in a minute. I included four questions on simple tasks. You can see the form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13v2fGt48H_3i5FlPIRNFyNKXXiUtS0yArO6ikYTWm70/viewform">here</a>. I decided to go for simple questions: can you write a loop? Can you write a function? </p>
<p>I'm not sure about this approach. <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/post-instructor.html">Software Carpentry</a> asks some more detailed questions in their instructor questionnaire. I'm curious how that plays out. I was worried that learners would be intimidated by involvement or detail and might underestimate their abilities. It seems like learners underestimate their ability to program more than any other skill I've ever encountered. I'm interested to see the results of their evaluations. If the more detailed questionnaires work out, I'd love to incorporate those types of questions into my surveys. I really just want to get good results.</p>
<p>Another challenge we encountered was asking about jargon. Preliminary results indicate that we use too much jargon and that this makes class hard to follow. But detailed comments left by one learner indicates that jargon might be so expansive as to include the term "loop." Not really sure about what to do on that one.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Keep an eye on - I'll post a more detailed summary of the evals once we have a little more participation.</p>
