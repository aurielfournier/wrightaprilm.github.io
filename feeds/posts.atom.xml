&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I've been reading and ruminating on course evaluations that we got from this round of our biocomputing &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014"&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt;. Previous post introducing the course is &lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/first_half.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and my thoughts on writing a good evaluation is &lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/evals.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We changed the course a lot since last year based on evaluations. The big change is that we added homework, which many students requested. What we wanted to learn is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do students enjoy about the class?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do they not like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we do to support learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's take a look at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We moved both too fast and too slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's wide variance in whether the course moved too fast. Novices think it did, more experienced people think it didn't. Hardly a surprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: There is some demand in the UT community for intermediate Python. I'm not super shocked at this, as there's no        real formal curriculum for learning specific languages at UT (beyond a CS course that is literally impossible for non-CS majors to      enroll in). The &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/"&gt;CCBB&lt;/a&gt; is ramping up its &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/ training.html"&gt;training programs&lt;/a&gt; and there might be some room there for development of courses that assume a higher baseline of knowledge and cover more      breadth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework helps. So do code fragments. Students who looked at code outside of class, did homework and reviewed notes are more confident in their ability to complete programming tasks on their own or with a little Google. Hardly a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: We currently exist outside of any sort of incentive structure. We can't give credit, nor can we levy consequences         for not doing your homework. If we're going to continue to operate outside the normal academic structure, we need to find some way to       motivate students to think about this material outside of class. Perhaps some sort of certificate? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who need to use programming for their work learned more stuff. It's very clear that "I need to graduate someday" or "I don't wanna post-doc forever" are great motivators. But early-stage graduate students (who have the time to be in class) don't have the data to apply their learning off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: We considered making it mandatory to have a data set that you're working with to join our class/support group.        But we have no way of enforcing this. I think the thing to do is to make a bank of example data sets, and assign people without data a      buddy and a dataset. Part of the homework could be to apply some aspect of the class material to the fake data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love Python, Pandas and in-class exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: #Pythonista4Life. Also, perhaps we should switch to a two-hour session. Right now, we do a 1.5-hour session. We       talk about some topic for about a half-hour to 45 minutes, and then take an exercise application break. Then we talk some more.     Perhaps we could switch to a format with two half-hour talk sessions, and two half-hour exercise breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were mostly good on jargon, except when we weren't. Most students said that we didn't use jargon and that they didn't feel lost very often. A couple students have a more expansive definition of jargon, including concepts like loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: I'm not really sure. There are some words you just have to know if you want to do programming. We generally       provide some kind of &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_2/CheatSheet.md"&gt;cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; with lessons.        There's a hard floor on how simple we can make things, and I think we've about hit it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the five-cent tour of our survey results, folks. Overall, we did well this year, in particular since we had some tough circumstances towards the start of the year (two lectures lost due to snow days). I feel positive about our evaluation format, as well. We got the information that we set out to get, and now we know what to work on for next year. I'll definitely be using these evaluation forms again. I don't want to share results publicly, since some are signed, but ping me if you want to talk in more depth about evaluations and results.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="education"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Wrighting Evaluations</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/first_half.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-07T04:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-04-07:posts/first_half.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a lot of readers may know, I teach a biological computing course, with my labmate Ben. We're a weird little entity: we're endorsed by the university's &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/semesterlong.html"&gt;Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;. We can't offer course credit, nor can we incentivize participation. This creates a really odd dynamic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students can come learn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But they have to be self-motivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students can get code feedback&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But they're putting in their own time and receiving no credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students can come hang out and get to know the UT biological programming community&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But again, this is time out of their day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break our semester into two halves. As you can see on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, there's a bit of basic python for the first few sessions. The second half is made up of speakers from the UT community coming to talk about how they use computation to make their work easier, faster, more reproducible, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also invite people for beer. To foster community, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's our intro course. We're sending out the evaluation surveys for the first half of the class in a bit here, so I'll be back with some analytics on retention in a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Wrighting Evaluations</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/wrighting_evals.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-30T02:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-03-30:posts/wrighting_evals.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Writing a good evaluation is hard.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often tell me to pick a couple things I want students in a course to have known and ask if they learned them. I think practically this is useful, but doesn't get at the full picture. There are lots of reasons a student might not learn something in a semester-long course. For instance, a few students have communicated to me that their PIs don't think it's worth it to take a course on computing, and won't give them an hour and a half in the afternoon to come to class, resulting in doing  a lot of learning on their own. Some people like Facebook more than doing programming exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What evaluation should really get at is what the instructors and other course facilitators could do to support learners. Which of our materials are students using? Which are they not? Are there some lectures that don't go well? How is our balance of exercise to talk time? What practical things could we do to improve the course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our round of evaluations following the first offering of the course went pretty well. People over all liked the course. They liked cheatsheets of core programming concepts from each lecture. They wanted homework to be assigned. They wanted more in-class exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time around, we offered more in-class exercises. We assigned homework. We made cheatsheets for lectures that didn't previously have them (i.e. &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_5/pandas_dtypes.md"&gt;Pandas types&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_5/pandas_slicing.svg"&gt;visual cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; to slicing/indexing. In short, this was a better course for long-term learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked a few main things that I wanted to know from students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the level of effort they put into the course?
    +Was there anything we could do to get them to increase that level of effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the students feel during class (lost, bored, etc)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we do to improve their experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they do some basic Python tasks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, what could we do help them pick up concepts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did they &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; programming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, then we don't like you and you can't come to my birthday party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting at what learners learned is hard. We've gotten some feedback in the form of homeworks. Turned in homeworks were consistently great, but most students didn't actually turn in homework weekly. More on this in a minute. I included four questions on simple tasks. You can see the form &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13v2fGt48H_3i5FlPIRNFyNKXXiUtS0yArO6ikYTWm70/viewform"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to go for simple questions: can you write a loop? Can you write a function? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about this approach. &lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/post-instructor.html"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; asks some more detailed questions in their instructor questionnaire. I'm curious how that plays out. I was worried that learners would be intimidated by involvement or detail and might underestimate their abilities. It seems like learners underestimate their ability to program more than any other skill I've ever encountered. I'm interested to see the results of their evaluations. If the more detailed questionnaires work out, I'd love to incorporate those types of questions into my surveys. I really just want to get good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge we encountered was asking about jargon. Preliminary results indicate that we use too much jargon and that this makes class hard to follow. But detailed comments left by one learner indicates that jargon might be so expansive as to include the term "loop." Not really sure about what to do on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on - I'll post a more detailed summary of the evals once we have a little more participation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="education"></category></entry><entry><title>SSC Short Course Materials</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/ssc_short.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-24T10:35:00-06:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-02-24:posts/ssc_short.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/ssc.html"&gt;Materials for spring 2014 SSC Python Short Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(And maybe a better person)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me, probably something you know about me is that I like to teach. 
Happiness is nothing if not shared; I like to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people ask me why I think that teaching is so much. And at the end of 
the day, the only thing I can really tell them is that the world is big. Really 
big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If we're going to start this blog with a positive jam, let's go to the big man
himself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something incredibly satisfying about seeing the lights go on and the 
wheels start to turn when someone gets their first loop. As an academic, my life
is pretty often an exercise in delayed gratification. But when you've done a 
good job teaching, your student goes from a pupil to a &lt;em&gt;colleague&lt;/em&gt;. That's 
powerful stuff. Makes my day, right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's also the altruistic stuff: you helped someone get to where
they needed to be, you're helping them make a better project. But feeling good
keeps you coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you're not convinced, I've compiled a list of reasons why teaching skills
(not just programming - could be any skill) to novices helps us all be better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a more articulate person for having to break ideas down into bite-sized
pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a more patient person for helping someone take their first steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a more conscientious programmer for seeing all the creative solutions
my students-cum-colleagues come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm better at documenting code, knowing someone who needs help might read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually kind of like the sound of my own voice. That's something I never
would have said when I started graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
